Based on the assumptions made, here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for the Facebook clone:

1. User
   - Properties: id, name, email, password, profile_picture, friends, posts
   - Methods: register, login, create_post, like_post, comment_on_post, share_post, add_friend

2. Post
   - Properties: id, user_id, content, timestamp, likes, comments, shares
   - Methods: add_like, add_comment, add_share

3. FriendRequest
   - Properties: sender_id, receiver_id, status
   - Methods: send_request, accept_request, reject_request

4. Message
   - Properties: id, sender_id, receiver_id, content, timestamp
   - Methods: send_message, get_messages

5. Photo
   - Properties: id, user_id, caption, image_url, timestamp
   - Methods: upload_photo, get_photos

Now, let's proceed with implementing the code for each file.

1. user.py

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class User:
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
    password: str
    profile_picture: str
    friends: list[int]
    posts: list[int]

    def register(self, name: str, email: str, password: str) -> None:
        # Register a new user
        pass

    def login(self, email: str, password: str) -> bool:
        # Login user and return True if successful
        pass

    def create_post(self, content: str) -> int:
        # Create a new post and return its ID
        pass

    def like_post(self, post_id: int) -> None:
        # Like a post
        pass

    def comment_on_post(self, post_id: int, comment: str) -> None:
        # Add a comment to a post
        pass

    def share_post(self, post_id: int) -> None:
        # Share a post
        pass

    def add_friend(self, friend_id: int) -> None:
        # Send a friend request
        pass
```

2. post.py

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Post:
    id: int
    user_id: int
    content: str
    timestamp: str
    likes: int
    comments: list[str]
    shares: int

    def add_like(self) -> None:
        # Add a like to the post
        pass

    def add_comment(self, comment: str) -> None:
        # Add a comment to the post
        pass

    def add_share(self) -> None:
        # Add a share to the post
        pass
```

3. friend_request.py

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class FriendRequest:
    sender_id: int
    receiver_id: int
    status: str

    def send_request(self) -> None:
        # Send a friend request
        pass

    def accept_request(self) -> None:
        # Accept a friend request
        pass

    def reject_request(self) -> None:
        # Reject a friend request
        pass
```

4. message.py

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Message:
    id: int
    sender_id: int
    receiver_id: int
    content: str
    timestamp: str

    def send_message(self, receiver_id: int, content: str) -> None:
        # Send a message to a user
        pass

    def get_messages(self, user_id: int) -> list[str]:
        # Get messages for a user
        pass
```

5. photo.py

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Photo:
    id: int
    user_id: int
    caption: str
    image_url: str
    timestamp: str

    def upload_photo(self, user_id: int, caption: str, image_url: str) -> int:
        # Upload a photo and return its ID
        pass

    def get_photos(self, user_id: int) -> list[int]:
        # Get photos for a user
        pass
```

This is the initial implementation of the core classes and their methods for the Facebook clone. Each class is defined as a dataclass to simplify the creation and management of objects. The methods within each class represent the actions that can be performed by users in the Facebook clone.

Next, we will create the entrypoint file that will serve as the starting point of the application.
