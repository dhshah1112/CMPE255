- Snake: Represents the snake in the game. Responsible for updating the snake's position, checking for collisions, and growing the snake when it eats food.
- Food: Represents the food in the game. Responsible for generating random positions for the food.

2. View:
- GameView: Responsible for rendering the game window, snake, food, and score.

3. Controller:
